                      CHAPTER 3: WEBSITE STRUCTURE DESIGN
Group A: Short Questions (2 Marks)

1. Define Information Architecture (IA).
Ans:Information Architecture (IA) is the practice of organizing, structuring, and labeling content in a way that makes information easy for users to find and understand. It focuses on how content is grouped, how navigation systems are designed, and how users move through information.
Good IA ensures that a website or application is logical, intuitive, and user-friendly, reducing confusion and improving overall usability.

2. What is a “Wireframe”?
Ans:A wireframe is a basic visual blueprint of a website or application that shows the layout of elements such as navigation menus, buttons, images, and content areas. 
It does not focus on colors, graphics, or final design details. Instead, wireframes help designers and stakeholders understand structure, functionality, and user flow before development begins, saving time and preventing costly redesigns later.

3. Explain the concept of “Cognitive Friction” in web design.
Ans:Cognitive friction refers to the mental effort required by users when interacting with a website. 
High cognitive friction occurs when layouts are confusing, navigation is unclear, instructions are complex, or users must think too hard to complete simple tasks. 
Reducing cognitive friction is essential in web design because users prefer interfaces that are simple, predictable, and easy to understand, allowing them to achieve goals quickly.

4. Why should URL slugs use hyphens instead of underscores?
Ans:Hyphens should be used in URL slugs because search engines treat hyphens as word separators, while underscores are often read as part of a single word. 
For example, web-design-tips is easier for both users and search engines to read than web_design_tips. Hyphens improve readability, usability, and SEO performance, making URLs clearer and more user-friendly.

5. Compare and contrast Hierarchical (Tree) structure and Linear (Sequential) structure. Give an example of when to use each.
Ans:A Hierarchical (Tree) structure organizes information in levels, starting from a main category and branching into sub-categories.
It allows users to choose their own path and navigate freely based on their needs. This structure is flexible, scalable, and ideal for handling large amounts of content.
Users can move between sections easily without following a fixed order.
Example:
A university website where content is divided into Admissions, Departments, Alumni, and Research. 
Each of these sections further branches into smaller categories.

A Linear (Sequential) structure, on the other hand, presents information in a fixed order.
Users must follow a step-by-step path, usually moving forward or backward. Navigation choices are limited, and users cannot skip steps easily. 
This structure is best when information must be consumed in a specific sequence.
Example:
An online course module or checkout process where users must complete Step 1 before moving to Step 2.

Comparison Summary:
Hierarchical structure is flexible, user-controlled, and suitable for large websites.
Linear structure is guided, restricted, and suitable for processes or tutorials.

6. Explain the “Three-Click Rule” and its significance in User Experience (UX) design.
Ans:The Three-Click Rule is a usability guideline which suggests that users should be able to find any information on a website within three clicks.
If users take more than three clicks, they may feel frustrated and abandon the site. While it is not a strict rule, it highlights the importance of efficient navigation and good information architecture.
The significance of the Three-Click Rule lies in reducing user effort and cognitive load. When information is easy to find, users feel confident and satisfied.
It encourages designers to create clear menus, logical page hierarchies, and meaningful links. Even if a task requires more than three clicks, the journey should still feel simple and intuitive.
In UX design, the focus is not just on the number of clicks but on how easy and logical each click feels. A well-structured website improves user engagement, retention, and overall satisfaction.

7. “Plan before you do.” Explain how tools like Card Sorting and Flowcharts help in planning a website’s structure.
Ans:Planning is a crucial step in website design because it helps avoid confusion, redesign, and poor user experience. 
Tools like Card Sorting and Flowcharts help designers plan a website’s structure effectively before development begins.
Card Sorting is a technique where users are given content items written on cards and asked to group them in a way that makes sense to them.
This helps designers understand how real users think and categorize information. It ensures that menus and navigation labels match user expectations rather than designer assumptions.
Flowcharts visually represent how users move through a website. They show page relationships, decision points, and user paths. Flowcharts help designers identify unnecessary steps, improve navigation flow, and ensure users can reach their goals easily.
Together, Card Sorting and Flowcharts reduce guesswork, improve usability, and create a clear, logical, and user-centered website structure, proving the importance of planning before implementation.

Group C: Scenario-Based Questions (5 Marks)
8. You are designing a website for a University. It has hundreds of pages (Admissions,
Departments, Alumni, News). Which structural model would you choose? Draw a rough
diagram and justify your choice.
Ans:For a university website containing hundreds of pages such as Admissions, Departments, Alumni, Research, and News, the most suitable structural model is a Hierarchical (Tree) structure.
A university website serves a wide variety of users including prospective students, current students, faculty members, parents, and alumni.
Each group looks for different types of information. A hierarchical structure organizes content from broad categories to more specific subcategories, making it easier for users to predict where information will be located.
This structure helps manage large volumes of information by grouping related content under clear headings. For example, all admission-related information can be placed under the Admissions section, while academic content can be organized under Departments or Academics.
Users can navigate directly to the relevant section without unnecessary steps.
The hierarchical model is also highly scalable. As the university grows and adds new programs, departments, or services, new pages can be added without disturbing the existing structure.
This improves usability, reduces confusion, and enhances the overall user experience.
Therefore, a hierarchical structure is ideal for a large and complex university website because it provides clarity, flexibility, and efficient navigation.

9. A user visits a website but leaves within 10 seconds because they cannot find the navigation
menu, which is hidden behind a small icon on a desktop screen. Analyze this design failure
using the ”KISS” (Keep It Simple) principle.
Ans:The KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle emphasizes that designs should be simple, clear, and easy to use.
In this scenario, the website fails because the navigation menu is hidden behind a small icon on a desktop screen, causing users to leave within 10 seconds.
On desktop devices, users expect navigation menus to be clearly visible. Hiding the menu behind a small icon increases cognitive effort and forces users to search for basic functionality.
This violates the KISS principle by adding unnecessary complexity to a simple task.
Because users cannot immediately see how to navigate the website, they become confused and frustrated. This results in high bounce rates and poor user engagement. 
The design prioritizes style over usability, which negatively affects user trust.
Applying the KISS principle would mean making the navigation menu visible, clearly labeled, and easy to access. 
Simpler design improves discoverability, reduces mental effort, and ensures users can quickly find what they are looking for.

10. An e-commerce website has a URL structure like www.shop.com/prod?id=55&cat=9. Explain why this is bad for both users and Search Engines (SEO), and propose a better
structure using Page Slugs.
Ans:The URL structure
www.shop.com/prod?id=55&cat=9
is an example of a poorly designed URL that negatively impacts both users and search engines (SEO).
A URL should be meaningful, readable, and descriptive, but this structure fails to meet those requirements.
Problems for Users
From a user’s point of view, the given URL is confusing and difficult to understand. It does not describe what product is being viewed and gives no indication of category or purpose. 
The presence of random numbers and symbols makes the URL hard to remember and difficult to share. Such URLs also reduce user trust, as they appear unprofessional and machine-generated rather than user-friendly.
Users prefer URLs that clearly tellthem what to expect on a page. When this information is missing, users may hesitate to click on the link, especially when viewing search results or shared links.
Problems for Search Engines (SEO)
Search engines use URLs as an important factor in understanding and ranking web pages. The given URL contains no relevant keywords related to the product or category. As a result, search engines cannot easily identify the content of the page, leading to poor indexing and lower rankings in search results.
Additionally, dynamic URLs with parameters such as id and cat can cause duplicate content issues if multiple URLs point to similar content. 
This further weakens SEO performance and reduces organic visibility.
Impact on Website Performance
Poor URLs negatively affect click-through rates because users are less likely to click on unclear links. They also make website maintenance and analytics harder, as the URLs do not provide meaningful information to developers or marketers.
Improved URL Structure Using Page Slugs
A better and more effective URL structure would use page slugs, such as:
www.shop.com/electronics/samsung-galaxy-s23
Page slugs are human-readable words that describe the page content clearly. They are easy to understand, easy to remember, and contain relevant keywords.
Advantages of Page Slugs
1.Improve readability and user trust
2.Help search engines understand page content
3.Increase search engine ranking potential
4.Improve click-through rates
